Implemented a simulation module for assessing correlated risk factors. The CIR model is used for simulating interest rates. Based on simulations of the exchange rate dynamics for the Ruble-Dollar pair, a fair value assessment for the Range Accrual product tied to the exchange rate has been conducted.
